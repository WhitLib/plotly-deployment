Using Plotly and the D3 library to create dashboards

### Overview 

The purpose of this project was to use the D3 library to read in an external json data file and the Plotly library to create Javascript data visualizations to display belly button bacterial biodiversity. The dashboard shown in the video below are several visual representations of the bacterial data for each of the study participants as well as a panel that displays their demographic information. The overall goal of this dashboard is to allow volunteers to identify the top 10 bacterial species present in their navels so that if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
